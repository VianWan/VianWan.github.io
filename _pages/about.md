<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master's candidate from the Department of Earth and Space Sciences, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen China, advised by [Prof. Dikun Yang](https://scholar.lanfanshu.cn/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BFpLy2cAAAAJ) and expected to be conferred upon Master degree in 2025. Over the past three years, I have been engaged in advancing geophysical methods and addressing engineering geophysics issues, including contamination site investigations and karst cave location.

My research interest includes:
- Electrical resisitivity tomography (ERT)
- Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) 
- Seismic ambient noise imaging
- Shallow surface geophysics, Environmental issues.

- When conducting a nearshore Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, there are difficulties such as the magnetometer being vulnerable to water and the magnetic field affected by seawater current and other electromagnetic interferences.
- To resolve such problems, the MT survey adopted by the inter-station pattern as an alternative regular measurement is preferable. An experiment of inter-station acquisition was conducted in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, which records the onshore magnetic field data and the seafloor electric field data nearly 3km away from the magnetic observation station.
- We hired two local fishing boats to conduct the acquisition of seafloor electric signals. One boat carried an electrode with a cable connected to the main ship, and the cable was manually laid into the water as the ship moved in a specific direction. When the boat reached its set location, we added the 3kg weights on the electrode to reduce the interference water flow may have on the position of the electrode, and then put it into the seafloor. Repeat this process until all four electrodes are set at the bottom of the sea. Whereafter, the main boat carrying the MT meter (MTU-5A), maintained a stable location and took measurements according to the pre-set script. Meanwhile, another MT meter recorded onshore magnetic signals simultaneously. After 18 hours of continuous data collection, the equipment was recovered.
- The impedance obtained from inter-station acquisition showed a downward trend in the low-frequency range compared to regular impedance, consistent with previous synthetic simulation results.
